Indeed, for each of the users you have been given, an anomaly/noise generation procedure was applied to corrupt the sample. The noise generation procedure depends on two variables: the noise level $p\\in [0,1]$ and the noise type $X\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$.  Each user has been randomly assigned a noise level $p$ and anomaly/noise type $X$, and subsequently been corrupted with the associated noise generation procedure. \n",

This task will be semi-supervised: only a very small number of labels is provided. You will therefore need to combine supervised and unsupervised approaches for this component. "
